# SparkAndDataLakeAWS
## Project 3 - STEDI Human Balance Analytics
### Project Overview
Using Spark and AWS Glue, this project involves processing data from diverse sources, categorizing, and curating it to facilitate future queries for various objectives.

As a data engineer on the STEDI Step Trainer team, your role is to extract data generated by STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the companion mobile app, and organize it into a data lakehouse on AWS. This curated data will support Data Scientists in training a machine learning model.

### Project Context
The STEDI team has developed a STEDI Step Trainer, which:

Helps users perform the STEDI balance exercise.
Incorporates sensors that collect data to train a machine-learning algorithm for step detection.
Comes with a mobile app that collects customer data and interacts with the sensors.
STEDI has received significant interest from early adopters eager to use the STEDI Step Trainers.

Many customers have started using their Step Trainers along with the mobile application to test their balance. The Step Trainer includes a motion sensor that records distances, while the mobile app leverages a phone's accelerometer to detect motion in the X, Y, and Z axes.

The team aims to use the motion sensor data to develop a machine learning model for real-time step detection, ensuring privacy concerns dictate what data can be utilized.

Some early adopters have consented to share their data for research. Only these customers' data should be included in the training dataset for the machine learning model.

### Project Summary
##### Landing Zone
###### Glue Tables Created (SQL DDL scripts):
